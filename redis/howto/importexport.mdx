title: Import/Export Data
---

## Using the Upstash Console

You can use the migration wizard in the
[Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com) to import your Redis data into Upstash.
On the database list page, click on the `Import` button, and you will see a dialog
like the one below:

    <Frame>
        <img src="/img/import/import.png"   width="60%" />
    </Frame>

You can move your data from either another Upstash database or a database from another
provider (or on-premise).

<Info>
  All the data will be deleted (flushed) in the destination database before the
  migration process starts.
</Info>

## Using upstash-redis-dump

You can also use the
[upstash-redis-dump](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis-dump) tool
to import/export data from another Redis.

Below is an example of how to dump and import data:

```shell
$ upstash-redis-dump -db 0 -host eu1-moving-loon-6379.upstash.io -port 6379 -pass PASSWORD -tls > redis.dump
Database 0: 9 keys dumped
```

See the [upstash-redis-dump repo](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis-dump) for
more information.
