title: Terraform Provider
---

You can use the Upstash Terraform provider to create your resources. An API key is
required in order to create resources.

### Configure Provider

The provider requires your email address and API key, which can be created in
the console.

```
provider "upstash" {
  email = ""
  api_key = ""
}
```

### Create Database

As input, you need to give the database name, region, and type.

```
resource "upstash_database" "mydb" {
  database_name = "testdblstr"
  region = "eu-west-1"
  type = "free"
}
```

You can output database credentials as follows:

```
output "endpoint" {
  value = "${upstash_database.mydb.endpoint}"
}

output "port" {
  value = "${upstash_database.mydb.port}"
}
output "password" {
  value = "${upstash_database.mydb.password}"
}
```
