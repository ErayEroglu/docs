## What is Upstash Redis?

Upstash is a serverless database service compatible with the RedisÂ® API.

## What is a Serverless Database?

- You do not have to manage or provision servers.
- You do not have to deal with configuring or maintaining any server.
- You just use the service and pay for what you use. If you are not using it, you should not be paying.

## What are the use cases?

Upstash works for all the common use cases for RedisÂ®. You can use Upstash in your serverless stack. In addition, you can use Upstash as storage (or caching) for your serverless functions. See [Use Cases](/redis/overall/usecases) for more.

## Do you support all RedisÂ® APIs?

Most of them. See [RedisÂ® API Compatibility](/redis/overall/rediscompatibility) for the list of supported commands.

## Can I use any Redis client?

Yes, Upstash is compatible with the Redis client protocol.

## Which cloud providers do you support?

Initially, we have AWS and GCP. Digital Ocean is planned.

## Which regions do you support in AWS?

We start with AWS-US-EAST-1 (Virginia), GCP-US-CENTRAL-1 (Iowa), AWS-US-WEST-1 (N. California), AWS-EU-WEST-1 (Ireland), and AWS-APN-NE-1 (Japan). We will add new regions soon. You can expedite this by telling us your use case and the region you need by emailing [feedback@upstash.com](mailto:feedback@upstash.com).

## Should my client be hosted in AWS to use Upstash?

No. Your client can be anywhere, but the clients in AWS regions will give you better performance.

## How do you compare Upstash with ElastiCache?

Upstash is serverless. With ElastiCache, you pay even if you do not use the database. See [Compare](/redis/overall/compare) for more info.

## How do you compare Upstash with Redis Labs or Compose.io?

Upstash is serverless. With Redis Labs or Compose.io, you always pay a lot when your data size is big but your traffic is low. With Upstash, the pricing is based on per request. See [Compare](/redis/overall/compare) for more info.

## Do you persist data?

Yes, by default, we write data to the disk. So, in case of a failure, you should not lose any data.

## Do you support Redis Cluster?

We support replication in the Premium type database. We do not support sharding yet.

## I have a database with 10GB of data, I pay nothing if I do not use it. Is that correct?

You only pay for the disk storage cost, which is \$0.25 per GB. For your case, you will pay \$2.5 monthly.

## What happens when I exceed the request limit on the Free Database (10,000 requests per day)?

The exceeding commands return an exception.

## When I upgrade my free database, do I lose data?

You do not lose data, but clients may disconnect and reconnect.

## Upstash is much cheaper than ElastiCache and Redis Labs for big data sizes (> 10GB). How is that possible?

Upstash's storage layer is multi-tiered. We keep your data in both memory and block storage (disk). The entries that are not accessed frequently are removed from the memory but stored on the disk. The latency overhead of idle entries is limited thanks to SSD-based storage. Multi-tiered storage allows us to provide more flexible pricing.

## Will my data be safe?

Upstash is a GDPR-compliant company. We do not share any user data with third parties. See our [Legal Documents](/common/help/legal) for more information.

## How do you handle the noisy neighbour problem? Do other tenants affect my database?

Databases are isolated in some aspects but still share some hardware resources such as CPU or network. To avoid noisy neighbor influence on these resources, there are specific quotas for each database. When they reach any of these quotas, they are throttled using a backoff strategy. When multiple databases sharing the same hardware are close to the limits, our system can add new resources to the pool and/or migrate some of the databases to distribute the load.

Also, if a database exceeds its quotas very frequently, we notify users whether they want to upgrade to an upper plan. Databases in enterprise plans are placed either on dedicated or more isolated hardware due to higher resource needs.
