### Ã°ÂÂÂ©Ã¢ÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ» Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where `mint.json` is located)

```
mintlify dev
```

### Ã°ÂÂÂ Publishing Changes

Changes will be automatically deployed to production after pushing to the default branch.

You can also preview changes using PRs, which generate a preview link of the docs.

#### Troubleshooting

- If Mintlify dev isn't running, run `mintlify install` to reinstall dependencies.
- If the page loads as a 404, make sure you are running it in a folder with `mint.json`.
