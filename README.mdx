# Mintlify Starter Kit

Click on `Use this template` to copy the Mintlify starter kit. The starter kit contains examples including:

- Guide pages
- Navigation
- Customizations
- API Reference pages
- Use of popular components

### ð©âð» Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command:

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where `mint.json` is):

```
mintlify dev
```

### ð Publishing Changes

Changes will be deployed to production automatically after being pushed to the default branch.

You can also preview changes using PRs, which generate a preview link of the docs.

#### Troubleshooting

- If Mintlify dev isn't running, run `mintlify install` to reinstall the dependencies.
- If a page loads as a 404, make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json`.
